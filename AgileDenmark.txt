#The Agile Community in Denmark {#AgileDenmark}

When I started to look for the agile community in Denmark, I was struck by how little it seemed to be. I know a lot of people who are interestes in agile development and I know a lot of companies are using some sort of agile methodology, but there was not much out in the public. It seemed, except for a few meet-up groups and conferences, to stay within each company.

**Off-line events and meet-ups**

The biggest event in Denmark to hear about agile methodologies and challenges is [GOTO Copenhagen](https://gotocph.com/) by far. It is run by Trifork A/S, a Danish consulting company. Every year it has 80-100 international speakers and every year some of them are sharing case studies and theories about working in an agile environment.

One way of meeting people with interest in discussing all things agile is to attend [Agile Copenhagen Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Agile-Copenhagen/). It is run by Allan Rennebo Jepsen and everyone in the group can decide what should be discussed at the sessions. Sometimes, when an international speaker is nearby, Allan invites them to give a talk at this group.

Eventhough [Foo Cafe Copenhagen](http://foocafe.org/copenhagen) is not entirely about agile development, you will often see sessions about something related to agility and you will surely meet like-minded people. 





**Bit of history**

XP came to Denmark with Kent Beck via the JAOO conference in the mid-90-ties. Before that, I am sure some companies were already being agile in their development maybe without knowing the words for it. Later, Scrum enchanted Denmark and every company with agile ideals would send their employees to get some sort of Scrum certification. Today, some companies are still onboarding with Scrum, while others are looking more into Lean and Kanban styles.
