There is an active agile community in Denmark. A number of user groups, meetups, networks and conferences make sure there is somewhere to go, if one is keen to learn more or share experiences.

**Off-line events and meet-ups**

![AgileEE](images/AgileEElogo.png)

The biggest one is [Agile Eastern Europe conference](http://agileee.org). Agile Eastern Europe and is annual and by a fact for a long time was the largest and probably is still most well-known Agile conference in the Eastern Europe.
The first AgileEE was held in September 2009. All the conferences were held in Kyiv (a.k.a. Kiev), Ukraine, which is nicely placed and easily reached to be a hub for Eastern European agilists. Over these years, we have had more than 1000 visitors, more than 100 speakers. Some of our speakers: Robin Dymond, Jutta Eckstein, Jurgen Appelo, J.B. Rainsberger, David Hussman, Vasco Duarte, Yves & Joppe Hanoulle, Mary Poppendieck, Henrik Kniberg, Paul Klipp, Allan Kelly, Sergey Dmitriev, Pawel Lipinski, Alistair Cockburn, Elisabeth Hendrickson, Gojko Adzic, Michael Spayd, Lyssa Adkins, Bjarte Bogsnes, Mattias Skarin, Tobias Mayer, Boris Gloger, Karl Scotland, Craig Larman, Tom Gilb, Liz Keogh, Claudio Perrone, Joshua Kerievsky, Stephen Parry, Andrea Tomasini, Pete Behrens.

Another great one is [XP Days Ukraine](http://xpdays.com.ua/) is completely devoted to Agile engineering practices. Talks on the conference will cover all main engineering practices: Unit Testing, TDD, Continuous Integration, BDD, Code Review, Refactoring, Acceptance Testing, etc. Such questions as architecture in Agile projects, technical debt, communication between developers and testers will also be discussed.

![Agile BaseCamp](images/AgileBaseCamplogo.png)

There is also [Agile BaseCamp conference](http://agilebasecamp.org/). It is smaller regional events, with primarily local speakers with some guests from abroad. This one happens not only in Kiev but other cities in Ukraine as well.

![Agile Pizza](images/AgilePizza.jpg)

Apart from these bigger conferences, there are also smaller community meetups. I can think of at least two to mention. #AgilePizza is a community gathering over a piece of pizza. It is held once in 2 to 4 weeks, mostly in Kiev while irregularity in other cities as well. Usually, it gathers 15-60 people depending on the topic, presenter, timing of the announcement, etc. Speakers are from within of our community. One could learn more and track events on a [Facebook stream of events](https://www.facebook.com/SCRUMguides/events).
Another one is a [Club of anonymous developers](http://xpinjection.com/uadevclub/). The very close concept with the focus on engineering practices and other engineering related questions. As you can guess, presented topics are usually technical.

**On-line community life**

{width=20%,float=right}
![](images/Slack.png)

The main spot for on-line activity relatively recently (in 2015) shifted into [new community platform build on #slack](https://agileukraine.slack.com/). At the moment of writing this article it has 250 members. Most of the characters of this book are present there. If you’d like to join, [feel simple form](https://goo.gl/zKmbSz).

There is also [Agile Ukraine web portal](http://www.agileukraine.org/) with various announcements and news.

**Bit of history**

If you’d like to learn more about a state of Agile in Ukraine and its history, I can point you to several resources.

One would be a presentation made at AgileEE2010 by [Tim Yevgrashyn](#TimofeyYevgrashyn) called “Ukrainian Agile: Peculiar properties of National Implementation”. [Slides are available](http://www.slideshare.net/tim.com.ua/agile-in-ukraine-5398245) and a [good report by Alexander Beletsky](http://beletsky.net/2010/10/agileee-2010-timofey-yevgrashyn-agile.html) from this presentation.

Another one is an interview that Ben Linders did with me for InfoQ for AgileEE2014, called [“Adoption of Agile in Eastern Europe”](http://www.infoq.com/news/2015/03/agile-eastern-europe).
