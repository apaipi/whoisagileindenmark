There is an active agile community in Denmark, but it can be hard to find. When agile principles and methods were adopted a lot of user groups about agile development popped up in Denmark. Today (2016) I was able to find 2 Linkedin groups about agile and 2 meetup groups who focus on agile; [one run by Allan Rennebo Jepsen](http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Copenhagen/) and one by [Morten ELvang](http://www.meetup.com/agilitylab/), both in Copenhagen. Most of the people who work as agile coaches or simply focus on agile methodologies have their own smaller networks. 



There are, of course the [GOTO Conference](https://gotocon.com/), which always has some agile focused sessions in the programme, but that is only once a year. Also, we have the [Foo Cafe](http://www.foocafe.org/copenhagen) which covers many subjects, among these agile. And the annual [Annual Coach Camp Denmark](http://accdk.org/)
